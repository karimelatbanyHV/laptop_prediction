# Laptop Price Regression
This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and screen size resolution. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate the price of a laptop given its specifications.

## Features
- Predicts laptop prices based on input features.
- make a pipe lines multiple regression algorithms for comparison.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Data visualization and feature analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of laptop specifications and their corresponding prices. It includes features such as:

- Brand
- Processor Type
- RAM Size
- Storage Capacity
- GPU
- Screen Size and resolution
- Operating System

The dataset was collected from various online retailers and has been preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables.

## Results
The best model achieved an R-squared value of 0.89 on the test set, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual prices.
